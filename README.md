This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It is designed to display images and associated with a gene name

## Requirements

[R](https://cran.r-project.org/) along with  r-cran-ggplot2, r-cran-uuid, r-cran-rjson to generate example images and json.
[nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en) to build and run react components.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `Rscript makeplots.R`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`
